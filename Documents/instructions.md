Okay, let's start with the project initialization.

First, regarding the virtual environment: I've created it in the .venv directory. To activate it in your own terminal (which you'll need to do whenever you work on the backend), navigate to the project root (`/Users/lee/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/bluey_toys`) and run:

```bash
source backend/.venv/bin/activate
```
My terminal tool cannot maintain an activated virtual environment state between commands, so you'll need to manage activation in your local terminal sessions.

Now, I'll proceed with the initialization steps:

1.  **Initialize Git Repository:**
OK. I have initialized a Git repository in the project root directory (`/Users/lee/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Projects/bluey_toys`).

Regarding activating the virtual environment: Please note that I cannot keep the virtual environment persistently active between commands. However, I will proceed with the next steps assuming it *is* active for any Python-related commands.

Now, let's initialize the frontend project using Next.js. I'll create a `frontend` directory for it.

Okay, the Next.js frontend project has been initialized in the `frontend` directory. It seems it was created inside the backend directory (frontend), which isn't ideal. I'll move it to the project root now.

Okay, let's integrate the Amazon service into the Flask app.

First, I need to see the current contents of app.py.Okay, let's add an API endpoint to app.py to expose the Amazon product search functionality.

I'll create a route `/api/products` that accepts a `region` query parameter (e.g., `/api/products?region=US`). It will then call our `search_bluey_products` function and return the results as JSON.


Now, you should be able to run the Flask app (`python backend/app.py` in your terminal, after setting the necessary Amazon environment variables) and test this endpoint.
